## Project: Rock, Paper & Scissors
It's a command-line application that allows you to play the popular game with AI

- When started, the program shows this prompt:
```
Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s)
```

- You always choose first. Enter "r", "p", or "s" to play. After that, you will see what had program chosen.
  It will also tell you who won. For example, if you played "paper", and the program played "rock", you win.
```
You played: paper
AI played: rock
You win
```

- The game will repeat until you quit by pressing "q"
